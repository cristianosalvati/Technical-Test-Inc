# Challenge

## :computer: How to execute

 * select project folder and build project using maven (mvn clean install)
   run jar file using "java -jar /target/payments-processor-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" 
   you have to install SDK release v11

## :memo: Notes

 * A spring boot app that listens to the message producer and process payment messages	
 * see "Documetation" folder for the Overall Achitecture document.
 
## :pushpin: Things to improve
 * complete the concrete implementation for payments and log repository;
 * implement a transaction entity (it is very rare that the Payment System use the unique Id generated from the Online/offline console), is more appropriate using a transaction id that is generated by the Payment System Process and correlated with the payment id of the original request;
 * store EVERY transactions using the log API, refering to a transaction status (the error entity) and to a payment. In this case you can log both errors and succesful operation (a transaction with null error);
 * Introducing in the architecture an "Account-Payment Adaptor" as part of the Account Manager module, just in case in the future want to extend the platform with an external third part online portal, with his own account portfolio.

## Issues
 I Found some issues installing and running Docker on my laptop:
 * Installing last update for linux enbedded (see issue1.png)
 * the docker-compose.yml for windows not need the "trailing slashes" on volumes (see issue2.png, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68273745/how-to-make-a-mount-shared-in-docker)
